# Probablity String Generator

### Brief
This is a small java project which is basically a coding problem asked in some company so I am trying to make it better
and learn new things while building it 

### What it does
It will take one file with string and its corresponsing probablity, Now you have to pass the number of iteration you want to 
go and choose one string from the file based on the probablity assigned to it and strore the result in separate file

### My Thought Process
Multiply the number of iteration for the file to the probablity of each element and then read everytime from that list if the list is 
not empty returned the corresponding string to it. Do it several times and decrease the count of the proabablity each time. and then get the string output and 
do batching and write the batch into the file


### Future Updates
I will improve this project 
	1. Batching
	2. Reading 
	3. Writing
	4. Array streams for copying and multipying by a constant
	5. Use java 8 features will writing the code
